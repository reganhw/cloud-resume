# Cloud Resume Challenge

This is the code for http://reganhw.site which I created for the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/).<br/>
I skipped the HTTPS configuration because it wasn't possible with a free Azure subscription.<br/>
The Cosmos DB uses NoSQL and the function app was written in Python.
